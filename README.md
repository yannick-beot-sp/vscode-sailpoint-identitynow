## Installation

Go to the extension menu or press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`X` and look for the extension "Identity Security Cloud". Click on the button `Install`.

The VSIX can be installed from the extension menu. Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`X` and in the menu, click `Install from VSIX...`.

## Add new tenant

The extension supports several tenants.

Open the **Command Palette** with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows or Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to find the command "ISC: Add tenant...".

Alternatively, you can click on the `+` in the SailPoint view.

You can add a tenant by using a Personal Access Token (PAT) or by using a short-lived access token (like one you can get from https://yourtenant.identitynow.com/ui/session).

It is also possible to add a tenant by using the following URIs:
`vscode://yannick-beot-sp.vscode-sailpoint-identitynow/addtenant?tenantName=company&accessToken=eyJh...&authenticationMethod=AccessToken` or
`vscode://yannick-beot-sp.vscode-sailpoint-identitynow/addtenant?tenantName=company&clientId=806c451e057b442ba67b5d459716e97a&clientSecret=***&authenticationMethod=PersonalAccessToken`.

## Import and export the config of a tenant

In the **SailPoint view**, right-click on a tenant to import or export config.

[^1]: Mandatory

#### Membership criteria

`membershipCriteria` follows _kind of_ SCIM filters

##### Attributes

There are 3 kind of attributes:

- **Identity Attribute**: the format is `identity.{attribute name}`. Ex: `identity.cloudLifecycleState`, `identity.type`, etc.
- **Account Attribute**: the format is `{source name}.attribute.{attribute name}`. If the source name contains space, the source name must be put between quotes or double-quotes
- **Entitlements**: the format is `{source name}.entitlement.{attribute name}`. If the source name contains space, the source name must be put between quotes or double-quotes

##### Attribute operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| eq       | equals      |
| ne       | not equals  |
| co       | contains    |
| sw       | starts with |
| ew       | ends with   |

##### Logical operators

| Operator | Description   |
| -------- | ------------- |
| and      | Logical "and" |
| or       | Logical "or"  |

##### Values

Values must be within `"` or `'`.

##### Grouping

Expressions can be grouped by using parenthesis.
Parenthesis are mandatory for 3-level expression but are optional otherwise.

##### Examples

Here are a few examples extracted from the unit tests:

```
identity.department eq 'Customer Service' and identity.cloudLifecycleState eq 'active'
'Active Directory'.entitlement.memberOf eq 'CN=Accounting,OU=Groups,OU=Demo,DC=seri,DC=sailpointdemo,DC=com' and 'Active Directory'.attribute.departmentNumber eq '1234'
(identity.department eq 'Customer Service' and identity.cloudLifecycleState eq 'active') or (identity.cloudLifecycleState eq 'active' and identity.jobTitle co 'Accounts Payable Analyst')
```
